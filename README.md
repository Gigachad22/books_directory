Repository Overview:

Welcome to the "Books Directory" project! This is my inaugural backend endeavor, crafted using NestJS, Prisma, and a Postgres Docker container, all written in Typescript. The project efficiently stores articles and user data in the database. In addition to handling CRUD operations on these tables, I've implemented user login and authentication using JWT tokens. Feel free to explore the repository for a detailed look into the codebase and project structure.
